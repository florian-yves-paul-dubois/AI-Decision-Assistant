# AI Decision Assistant

This project simulates an AI assistant to determine the best commuting option based on conditions like weather, traffic, and appointments. The assistant suggests whether to work from home, drive, or take public transport.

## Features

- Decision-making based on:
  - **Rain**: Work from home if it’s raining.
  - **Traffic**: Avoid driving in heavy traffic.
  - **Early Meetings**: Prefer working from home.
  - **Strikes**: Public transport is unavailable during strikes.
  - **Appointments**: Drive if there’s a doctor’s appointment.
  - **Road Construction**: Adjust driving recommendations.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/florian-yves-paul-dubois/AI-Decision-Assistant.git
